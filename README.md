# ![nf-validation](docs/images/nf-validation.svg)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`nf-validation` has now been deprecated and won't be updated anymore.**
>
> **Please update your pipelines to use [`nf-schema`](https://github.com/nextflow-io/nf-schema) instead.**
> 
> This change was necessary to prevent older versions of `nf-core` pipelines from breaking when updating to the latest version of `nf-validation`. Some older and current versions of the pipelines did not pin the version of nf-validation, which caused the pipelines to break when the latest version of nf-validation was released. This change will prevent this from happening in the future. **Please pin the version of `nf-schema` in your pipeline's `nextflow.config` file.**

## üìö Docs üëâüèª <https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-validation>

**A Nextflow plugin to work with validation of pipeline parameters and sample sheets.**

## Introduction

This [Nextflow plugin](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/plugins.html#plugins) provides a number of functions that can be included into a Nextflow pipeline script to work with parameter and sample sheet schema. Using these functions you can:

- üìñ Print usage instructions to the terminal (for use with `--help`)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Print log output showing parameters with non-default values
- ‚úÖ Validate supplied parameters against the pipeline schema
- üìã Validate the contents of supplied sample sheet files
- üõ†Ô∏è Create a Nextflow channel with a parsed sample sheet

Supported sample sheet formats are CSV, TSV, JSON and YAML.

## Quick Start

Declare the plugin in your Nextflow pipeline configuration file:

```groovy title="nextflow.config"
plugins {
  id 'nf-validation'
}
```

This is all that is needed - Nextflow will automatically fetch the plugin code at run time.

> [!NOTE]
> The snippet above will always try to install the latest version, good to make sure
> that the latest bug fixes are included! However, this can cause difficulties if running
> offline. You can pin a specific release using the syntax `nf-validation@2.0.0`

You can now include the plugin helper functions into your Nextflow pipeline:

```groovy title="main.nf"
include { validateParameters; paramsHelp; paramsSummaryLog; fromSamplesheet } from 'plugin/nf-validation'

// Print help message, supply typical command line usage for the pipeline
if (params.help) {
   log.info paramsHelp("nextflow run my_pipeline --input input_file.csv")
   exit 0
}

// Validate input parameters
validateParameters()

// Print summary of supplied parameters
log.info paramsSummaryLog(workflow)

// Create a new channel of metadata from a sample sheet
// NB: `input` corresponds to `params.input` and associated sample sheet schema
ch_input = Channel.fromSamplesheet("input")
```

## Dependencies

- Java 11 or later
- <https://github.com/harrel56/json-schema>

## Slack channel

There is a dedicated [nf-validation Slack channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C056RQB10LU) in the [Nextflow Slack workspace](nextflow.slack.com).

## Credits

This plugin was written based on code initially written within the nf-core community,
as part of the nf-core pipeline template.
