# Basic samplesheet conversion

This example shows how to convert a samplesheet to a list that can be easily converted to a channel for usage in the pipeline.

There's one example log file provided in this directory:
- `log.txt`: This log file shows the output when running the pipeline, which prints out the samplesheet converted to a channel from a list.
