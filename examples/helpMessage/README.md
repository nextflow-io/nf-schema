# Help Message

This example demonstrates how to generate a help message for a given schema using the nf-schema project. The pipeline takes a schema file as input and produces a help message that describes the parameters and their usage.

There are two example log files provided in this directory:
- `log.txt`: This log file is created by running the pipeline with the `--help` option. It contains the help message generated for the schema.
- `log_outdir.txt`: This log file is created by running the pipeline with the `--help outdir` option. It contains the help message for the `outdir` parameter specifically.
