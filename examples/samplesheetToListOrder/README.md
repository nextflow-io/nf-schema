# Samplesheet conversion order

This example shows how to convert a samplesheet to a list. This example demonstrates that the order of the fields in the samplesheet can be changed freely while maintaining the same output list order. The output order of each entry in the list (which is the output from `samplesheetToList`) is based on the order of the fields in the schema.

There's one example log file provided in this directory:
- `log.txt`: This log file shows the output when running the pipeline.
