# Warn unrecognised parameters

This example demonstrates how to warn when unrecognized parameters are used in a pipeline using the nf-schema plugin.

There's one example log file provided in this directory:
- `log.txt`: This log file shows the output when running the pipeline with unrecognized parameters, which results in a warning message.
